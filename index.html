            Wearable computing is becoming the next transformational technology that is shaping the future of the technological landscape.
            WearTech is a platform that provides students with resources and bridges them to the wearable industry.
            We are more than just a student club.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            WearTech is an engineering student club started by a group of University of Toronto students to make wearable technology more accessible
            to students who wish to gain greater understanding and develop skills related to the industry.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Our goal at WearTech is to promote and enrich students with knowledge pertaining to wearable technologies through workshops,
            seminars, and design projects. Students will be working with cutting-edge technologies including, but not limited
            to, software development, mobile development, embedded systems programming, hardware programming, and mechanical
            prototyping.
